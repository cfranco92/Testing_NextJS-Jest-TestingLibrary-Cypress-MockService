# 3 Next .js Data Fetching

## Data Fetching & Strategies

```

## WINDOWS USERS: important note about name of course repository

### The symptom

Errors like this when you try to run your project after cloning from the course repository:

error - ./node_modules/next/dist/client/dev/amp-dev.js

Module not found: Can't resolve 'C:\path-to-your-cloneudemy-NEXTJS-TESTING\base-concert-venue\node_modules\next\dist\compiled\regenerator-runtime\runtime.js' in 'C:\path-to-your-clone\udemy-NEXTJS-TESTING\base-concert-venue\node_modules\next\dist\client\dev'

Note this part of the path in the "Module not found" detail:

path-to-your-cloneudemy-NEXTJS-TESTING

It's missing the \ in between path-to-your-clone and udemy-NEXTJS-TESTING.

### The cause

This error is caused by a bug in Next.js since version 12.0.4 on Windows, which omits the \ before any directory in the project path that starts with the characters ud. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### The fix

Rename the cloned directory from your course repository so it doesn't start with ud -- perhaps rename it to "nextjs-testing-udemy" instead of "udemy-NEXTJS-TESTING".

### Small print

Note: I could have changed the name of the repository not to start with ud. I chose not to do that because it would have required me to change all of the resource links in the course as well as video showing the repository -- and then change all of that back after the bug is fixed (so that I can keep my repository naming convention consistent with other courses).

I am watching this bug and will remove this note when it has been fixed.
